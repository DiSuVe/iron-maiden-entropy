**Please send me a message if you need access to the dataset!**

## About the Project  
This project analyzes the entropy of Iron Maiden’s lyrics to explore how their lyrical complexity has evolved over time. It also investigates whether lyrical entropy correlates with Spotify streaming popularity.  

## Methods  
- **Data Collection:** Lyrics were scraped from AZLyrics and manually curated.  
- **Entropy Calculation:** Shannon entropy was used to measure the complexity of lyrics.  
- **Analysis:** Lyrical entropy trends were examined across albums, and regression models were used to test its relationship with streaming numbers.  

## Dataset  
- 158 Iron Maiden songs from 17 studio albums (1980–2021).  
- Instrumentals and non-studio album songs were excluded.  
- Cleaned and formatted for entropy analysis.  

## Key Findings  
1. **Iron Maiden’s lyrical entropy has generally increased over time** 
2. **Lyrical entropy does not strongly correlate with Spotify streams**
